# Study-web-server-socket

A study repository for exploring web server and socket technologies, with a focus on real-time collaboration and system design.

### Focus Areas:
1. Real-time Collaboration
- CRDT: Study and implementation of conflict-free replicated data types.
- Three.js Co-Working: Exploring 3D collaboration in Three.js environments.
- Collaborative UI Design: Designing user interfaces to enhance real-time co-editing experiences.

2. Server and Cloud Storage
- Data Backup: Implementing mechanisms to save user data as backup files.
- Image Storage: Efficiently handling image uploads and storage for collaborative tools.
- Cloud Architecture: Investigating scalable storage solutions for collaboration.

3. Push notification

- Event-Driven Updates: Triggering notifications based on server-side events.

4. User and Access Management
- User Organization Management: Structuring multi-user organizations for collaborative tools.
- Access Control Models:
  - MAC (Mandatory Access Control): Enforcing strict rules based on policy.
  - DAC (Discretionary Access Control): Allowing user-defined permissions.
  - RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Assigning access based on user roles.

### Goals
- Build a foundational understanding of web server and socket technologies.
- Explore real-world implementations of collaborative tools.
